## In this simulation the following were completed using the given context but self-guided:
- Completed the Back-End Engineering job simulation, taking over the development of an unfinished project for the Lyft Rentals team.
- Drafted a UML class diagram representing a new reorganized architecture.
- Refactored a messy codebase inherited from another team to accurately reflect my new design.
- Implemented unit tests and added new functionality using test-driven development.
